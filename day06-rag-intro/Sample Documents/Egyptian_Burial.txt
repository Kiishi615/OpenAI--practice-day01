Ancient Egyptian burial practices were closely tied to their beliefs about death, the soul, and the afterlife. For the Egyptians, death was not an end but a transition, and how a person was buried had a direct impact on their fate in the next world. Over more than 3,000 years, those practices changed and developed, but some core ideas stayed remarkably consistent.

At the heart of Egyptian burial customs was the belief that human beings had several spiritual components, especially the ka and the ba. The ka was a kind of life force or vital essence; it needed food and drink to continue existing. The ba was more like personality or individuality, often shown as a human-headed bird that could move between the living world and the afterlife. Both of these aspects needed a preserved physical body or at least a lasting image (a statue, relief, or coffin portrait) to anchor them. This is why the preservation of the body—mummification—was so important.

In the earliest periods (Predynastic and early Old Kingdom), bodies were often buried in shallow pits in the desert. The hot, dry sand naturally dried out the body and preserved it quite well. The dead were usually placed on their side in a crouched position, with simple grave goods like pottery, beads, tools, and sometimes food. Over time, as people began to build more substantial tombs to protect the dead from animals and grave robbers, they unintentionally interrupted this natural preservation. Burials inside wooden coffins or simple mud-brick structures meant bodies decayed more easily, which pushed the Egyptians toward deliberate artificial preservation: the development of mummification.

By the time mummification became sophisticated (especially in the New Kingdom and later), the process was elaborate and specialized. The body was first washed and purified. Then embalmers removed the internal organs that decayed most easily—the liver, lungs, stomach, and intestines—through an incision in the left side of the abdomen. These organs were treated with preserving substances and placed in canopic jars, each protected by one of the Four Sons of Horus. The heart, however, was left inside the body because it was considered the seat of thought, memory, and moral character and would be needed for the judgment in the afterlife. The brain, which they did not consider important, was usually removed through the nose and discarded.

After organ removal, the body was dried with natron, a naturally occurring salt mixture found in Egypt. This drying lasted many days, often around 40 days or more. Natron drew moisture out of the body, preventing decay. Once dried, the body cavity was sometimes packed with linen, sawdust, or resin to keep its shape. The skin might be coated with oils, resins, and unguents to help preserve it, then the whole body was wrapped in many layers of linen bandages. Amulets and charms—such as scarabs, ankhs, and eye of Horus amulets—were placed between the wrappings at particular positions for magical protection. Prayers and spells might be spoken during wrapping. Wealthier individuals and royals received more careful, costly treatments, while poorer people had simpler, less thorough versions.

The ritual aspect of burial was as important as the physical treatment. One major ceremony was the “Opening of the Mouth” ritual, performed on the mummy or on a statue of the deceased. Using special tools that might touch the mouth, eyes, and ears, priests symbolically “opened” the senses of the dead so they could eat, speak, see, and hear in the afterlife. It was believed that, without this ritual, the dead person couldn’t properly function in the next world.

Tombs evolved significantly across Egyptian history, reflecting both social status and changing religious ideas. Early on, elite burials were in mastabas—rectangular, flat-roofed structures made of mud brick or stone, with underground burial chambers and rooms above for offerings. In the Old Kingdom, the most famous development was the pyramid. The step pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara and later smooth-sided pyramids like those at Giza were monumental tomb complexes for kings. These pyramids were surrounded by temples, causeways, and subsidiary burials for queens and nobles.

Inside royal tombs and in the chapels of non-royal tombs, walls often carried painted or carved scenes. These scenes weren’t just decoration; they were functional. They showed the deceased performing activities they wanted to continue in the afterlife—farming, fishing, feasting, enjoying music and dance. The belief was that representing these activities magically ensured their availability. Texts carved or written on the walls or on the coffin—such as Pyramid Texts in the Old Kingdom, Coffin Texts in the Middle Kingdom, and later the Book of the Dead—acted as spellbooks to guide and protect the deceased through the dangers of the underworld.

By the New Kingdom, royal burials moved away from visible pyramids into hidden rock-cut tombs in places like the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens. These tombs had long corridors and multiple chambers, with walls covered in religious scenes and texts describing the sun god’s nightly journey through the underworld, the judgment of the dead, and the transformations of the king into a divine being. Ordinary people, though never on the same scale, copied aspects of this. Wealthier commoners had rock-cut or masonry tombs with chapels for offerings, decorated with scenes of daily life and texts for protection.

Funerary equipment was another key part of burial. Besides the mummy itself, there was often a nested set of coffins—an inner anthropoid (human-shaped) coffin, sometimes more coffins inside a large rectangular outer coffin or sarcophagus. These were decorated with the name and titles of the deceased, magical texts, and images of gods and protective symbols. The coffin itself was considered a magical container and a substitute body: even if the mummy were destroyed, the coffin’s image could serve as a stand-in.

Grave goods reflected what the deceased would need in the next life. Food offerings were essential, often in the form of bread, beer, meat, fruits, and vegetables. These could be real food placed in containers or carved and painted representations. Everyday objects—furniture, combs, mirrors, tools, clothing, jewelry, board games like senet—were placed in the tomb, especially for the wealthy. In royal burials, the scale was enormous: chariots, weapons, statues, shrines, even entire boats or boat models to help the king travel in the afterlife and with the sun god.

A notable type of object was the shabti (or ushabti) figure, which became common in the New Kingdom and later. These small human-shaped figurines, often inscribed with a spell from the Book of the Dead, were intended to serve as laborers in the afterlife. When the gods called the deceased to work in the fields of the next world, the shabti would respond instead, taking on the labor. High-status burials could include hundreds of shabtis, sometimes with overseer figures, forming a sort of miniature labor force.

Judgment in the afterlife was a central concept tied to burial practice. The Egyptians believed that after death, a person’s heart would be weighed against the feather of Maat, the goddess of truth and cosmic order. This scene is famously depicted in manuscripts of the Book of the Dead: the dead person’s heart is placed on a scale opposite the feather, under the eye of Osiris and other gods. If the heart was lighter or equal in weight, the person was justified and allowed into the blissful Field of Reeds, a perfected version of Egyptian life. If the heart was heavy with wrongdoing, it would be devoured by the monster Ammit, and the person would suffer a “second death,” annihilation. To help pass this test, texts, spells, and protective amulets—such as heart scarabs inscribed with special formulas—were included as part of the burial.

It’s also important to recognize that Egyptian burial practices varied by social class and period. Only a tiny royal and elite minority could afford pyramids or richly decorated tombs; scribes, craftsmen, and middle-class people had smaller tombs or simpler shafts, sometimes sharing family plots. Even the poorest, however, commonly received some form of burial and modest offerings, because burial was socially and religiously important. Over time, certain elements that began as royal privileges—like afterlife texts or specific amulets—trickled down to broader segments of society.

Religious changes influenced burial norms as well. The rise of Osiris as a central god of the dead made afterlife hopes more widely available beyond the king. Initially, only the pharaoh was thought to ascend to the heavens and live among the gods; gradually, ordinary people expected their own judgment and hoped for their own eternal life, provided they were properly buried and morally upright. During the Amarna period under Akhenaten, there were shifts in artistic style and religious emphasis, but traditional burial concepts reasserted themselves quickly after his reign ended.

Throughout all these changes, the core goals of Egyptian burial practice remained consistent: preserve the body; equip the deceased with spells and objects; feed and honor them through offerings; and ensure that they could successfully navigate the underworld and live eternally. Tombs were not just graves but complex religious machines designed to bridge the world of the living and the world of the dead.

Family and community played an ongoing role after burial. Tombs were built with chapels where the living could visit, recite prayers, and bring offerings. False doors carved on tomb walls served as magical doorways through which the ka could emerge to receive offerings. Inscriptions often begged passersby to “speak my name” and recite a formula on behalf of the deceased, because spoken words had power and could refresh the spirit. Thus, remembrance by the living was part of ensuring the continued existence of the dead.

In all, ancient Egyptian burial practices grew from a deep concern with continuity—keeping a person’s identity, memory, and social ties alive beyond death. The elaborate mummification, the richly furnished tombs, the complex spells and rituals, and the ongoing offerings all served the same purpose: to secure a safe passage to the afterlife and an eternal, ideal version of life in a world ruled by the gods and sustained by cosmic order.

The rise of electric cars in Europe has been driven by a mix of climate policy, industrial strategy, technology improvements, and shifting consumer attitudes. Over roughly the last decade, electric vehicles (EVs) have moved from a niche product to a major part of Europe’s car market, and they are reshaping everything from car manufacturing to energy infrastructure.

At the core of this rise is policy. The European Union has set aggressive climate targets, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions and aiming for climate neutrality mid-century. Road transport is a major source of emissions, so decarbonizing cars is essential. To push the industry in that direction, the EU has introduced strict CO₂ emission standards for new cars. These rules effectively force manufacturers to sell more low- and zero-emission vehicles or face heavy fines. In addition, many European countries offer financial incentives for EV buyers, such as purchase subsidies, tax breaks, and lower registration fees. Some cities give electric cars access to bus lanes, free or cheaper parking, and exemptions from congestion charges or low-emission zone fees. Together, these policies have lowered the cost and increased the attractiveness of EVs.

Over time, several European countries have also announced future bans or phase-outs of new petrol and diesel cars. Norway, though not an EU member but part of the wider European market, has been especially ambitious, with a target that all new car sales be zero-emission within this decade. Other countries, such as the UK and some EU states, have similar timelines for ending the sale of internal combustion engine cars, though details and dates can vary. Even where bans are not yet law, they send a clear signal to automakers and investors about the direction of the market.

On the industry side, European car manufacturers have undergone a major shift. Traditional automotive giants like Volkswagen, Stellantis (which includes brands such as Peugeot, Fiat, and Opel), Renault, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz initially experimented with small-scale electric models, but now most have multi-billion-euro plans to electrify their entire lineups. They are rolling out dedicated electric platforms, launching a wave of new models in all segments—small city cars, family cars, SUVs, vans, and high-end performance vehicles. Some brands have announced that they will sell only electric or at least predominantly electric cars in Europe by the 2030s.

At the same time, new players, including Tesla and several Chinese manufacturers, have entered and disrupted the European market. Tesla helped change perceptions of EVs by offering long range, strong performance, and advanced software. Chinese brands are increasingly important, competing especially on cost and sometimes undercutting European models. Their presence has increased competitive pressure and pushed European manufacturers to accelerate their own EV strategies and improve price and quality.

Technological progress, especially in batteries, has been a key enabler. Lithium-ion battery costs have fallen sharply over the last decade. At the same time, energy density has improved, meaning cars can travel farther on the same size battery. Early electric cars had limited range and long charging times, which made many drivers nervous about running out of power. Newer models often offer ranges that are adequate for typical daily use and many longer trips, and fast-charging capabilities have improved, allowing significant top-ups in around half an hour or less on suitable chargers. These advances have made EVs more practical and have broadened their appeal beyond early adopters.

Charging infrastructure is another critical component of the rise of electric cars. Europe has been building out networks of public charging stations along highways, in city centers, in parking garages, and at workplaces. Countries like the Netherlands, Norway, and Germany have relatively dense charging networks, making it easier for drivers to rely on electric cars. High-power fast-charging corridors now link many major cities, facilitating long-distance travel by EV. That said, infrastructure is uneven, with some regions lagging behind, and rural areas sometimes less well served than urban ones. Still, the direction is clear: each year brings more chargers and better coverage.

Most EV charging actually happens at home or at work, and this is one reason why electric cars are particularly suited to Europe’s many people who have off-street parking or assigned parking spaces. Being able to plug in overnight means you start most days with a full “tank”, which is a different experience from conventional refueling. For those who rely on street parking, however, charging can be more challenging, so many cities are experimenting with solutions such as curbside chargers, charging points integrated into street lamps, and car-sharing schemes.

The energy system is also being affected. Europe has been increasing the share of renewable energy in its electricity mix, especially wind and solar. As this continues, driving on electricity tends to result in lower lifetime emissions than driving petrol or diesel, even when you consider the emissions from battery production. In countries with cleaner grids, EVs can already be significantly better from a climate perspective, and this advantage should grow as the grid decarbonizes further. At the same time, the rise of EVs means electricity demand patterns will change. Managed charging (for example, encouraging people to charge at times of lower demand or high renewable output) can help integrate EVs smoothly into the grid and reduce strain on infrastructure.

Consumer attitudes have evolved as well. Early on, many people doubted EV reliability, range, and overall practicality. Over time, as more models appeared and more neighbors, friends, and colleagues started driving them, those concerns have softened for many. Lower running costs have been an important selling point: electricity is often cheaper per kilometer than petrol or diesel, and EVs typically have fewer moving parts and lower maintenance needs (no oil changes, fewer parts in the drivetrain, and so on). For company fleets and high-mileage drivers, these savings can be significant.

However, price remains a major issue. While EV prices have been falling and there are now more mid-range and smaller models, many electric cars still have higher upfront purchase prices than comparable conventional cars, especially without subsidies. This can be a barrier for lower-income buyers and for markets where government support is limited. As battery costs continue to decline and manufacturing scales up, many analysts expect EVs to reach purchase price parity with conventional cars in more segments, which should further accelerate adoption.

Another factor in the rise of EVs in Europe is air quality and urban policy. Many European cities struggle with air pollution from traffic. To improve air quality, some cities have established low-emission or zero-emission zones where older or more polluting vehicles are restricted or have to pay higher fees. Electric cars are often exempt or treated more favorably, giving urban drivers a strong incentive to switch. In the longer term, several cities have plans to significantly reduce or eliminate internal combustion vehicles from their centers, favoring public transport, cycling, walking, and zero-emission vehicles. Electric cars are one piece of this broader urban mobility shift.

Despite all this progress, challenges remain. Charging infrastructure, as mentioned, is still uneven. Regulatory frameworks and incentives differ between countries, leading to different adoption rates. Norway, for example, has extremely high EV market shares thanks to generous, long-standing incentives, while other countries lag. There are also concerns about the supply chain for batteries, including the mining of raw materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel, and the environmental and social impacts associated with them. Europe is responding by trying to develop its own battery industry, set sustainability standards, diversify supply sources, and promote battery recycling.

Battery recycling and second-life uses are emerging as important topics. As EV batteries age, their capacity gradually declines, but they may still be useful for stationary storage (for example, storing solar power for later use) before eventually being recycled to recover valuable materials. Europe is developing regulations to ensure that batteries are collected, reused, and recycled, aiming to reduce waste and dependence on raw material imports.

Another layer of complexity is the ongoing shift in worldwide competition. European manufacturers face pressure from established EV makers like Tesla and from newer entrants, especially from China, where large-scale production has helped drive costs down. The EU has responded with trade and industrial policies aimed at protecting and strengthening its own automotive and battery industries while still aiming to keep EVs affordable and widely available.

Overall, the rise of electric cars in Europe is not just a story about a new type of car; it’s about a broader transition in transport, industry, and energy. Electric vehicles are becoming a central pillar of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and modernize the automotive sector. They are reshaping supply chains, influencing urban planning, and changing how people think about mobility. While the pace of change differs across countries and there are still important obstacles to overcome, the trajectory is clear: electric cars are shifting from the margins to the mainstream of Europe’s transport landscape.

Butterfly migration is one of the more remarkable natural phenomena, especially considering how small and fragile these insects appear. Despite their size, some species can travel thousands of kilometers, cross mountain ranges, deserts, and even large bodies of water. The best-known example is the monarch butterfly in North America, but there are many other migratory species around the world. Understanding how they manage these journeys requires looking at their biology, behavior, navigation, and environmental cues.

First, not all butterflies migrate. Most species live their entire lives in a relatively small area, moving only short distances to find food or mates. Migration is usually an adaptation to environments where conditions change dramatically with the seasons—especially temperature and availability of host plants for caterpillars and nectar for adults. Species that migrate often breed in one region when conditions are favorable and then move to another region to avoid cold or drought.

Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are the most famous migrants. In eastern North America, monarchs travel from as far north as Canada to central Mexico, a journey that can exceed 3,000–4,000 kilometers. A similar, slightly shorter migration happens in western North America between the interior and the California coast. What makes monarch migration particularly fascinating is that the individuals that arrive in Mexico are not the same individuals that left in the spring. It takes several generations to complete the yearly cycle.

A typical monarch annual cycle works roughly like this: in spring, butterflies leave the overwintering sites (in Mexico or on the California coast) and move northward, laying eggs on milkweed plants along the way. Those eggs hatch into caterpillars, pupate, and emerge as adults that continue the journey north. There can be two or three such generations moving northward through spring and summer. Then, in late summer and early fall, a special generation is produced. These butterflies do not become reproductively active immediately and instead enter a state called reproductive diapause. They live much longer than summer generations—up to eight or nine months instead of a few weeks—and undertake the long southward migration to the overwintering sites. There, they cluster in trees, conserving energy until the next spring, when they finally mate and start the cycle again.

This generational relay is a key part of how monarchs manage long distances. By spreading the trip across multiple generations in one direction and then having a long-lived generation handle the return, they effectively use their life cycle to solve the problem of time and distance.

Monarchs are not alone in their migratory habits. The painted lady butterfly (Vanessa cardui) is another long-distance migrant found on multiple continents. In some years, painted ladies in Europe travel from North Africa and the Mediterranean all the way to Scandinavia and even the Arctic Circle, again over multiple generations. In Africa, there is evidence of incredibly long-range movements between the Sahel and northern Europe. Other examples include the red admiral (Vanessa atalanta), which migrates in Europe and North America, and various species of whites and sulfurs (family Pieridae) that move to track seasonal changes in host plants and climate.

How do butterflies physically manage such demanding journeys? One key factor is their energy management. Migratory butterflies often feed heavily before and during migration, storing energy mostly as fat. Monarchs, for example, build up substantial fat reserves in their abdomen before setting off toward Mexico. Nectar from flowers is the primary fuel source, but they can also use other sources like tree sap or overripe fruit. During flight, they burn these fat reserves gradually. Unlike birds, butterflies cannot store massive energy reserves relative to their body weight, so they rely on frequent refueling stops and efficient flight behavior.

Their flight mechanics are surprisingly efficient for their size. They are lightweight, with large wings relative to their body mass, which makes powered flight less costly in terms of energy. They also often take advantage of favorable winds. Observations and tracking studies show that monarchs, for example, tend to migrate on days when wind conditions support their direction of travel. They can also use soaring and gliding flight when thermal updrafts (rising columns of warm air) are available, allowing them to gain altitude without constant flapping and then glide forward, saving energy. While butterflies aren’t as specialized for soaring as some large birds, they still benefit from these basic aerodynamic opportunities.

Another central question is navigation: how does an animal with a brain the size of a pinhead find its way across an entire continent, and how do individuals reach the same overwintering sites that their parents and grandparents visited, even though they themselves have never been there? Migratory butterflies use a combination of environmental cues.

The most important known cue for long-distance orientation is the sun. Butterflies use a “sun compass,” maintaining a steady angle relative to the sun’s position in the sky. The complication is that the sun moves across the sky during the day, so if a butterfly simply kept flying at the same angle to the sun, it would eventually veer off-course. To correct for this, they rely on an internal circadian clock—essentially a time-keeping mechanism—in their bodies that lets them adjust their orientation in relation to the time of day. Studies on monarchs have shown that this clock is located in part in their antennae. When researchers altered the light-dark cycle of the antennae, the butterflies’ directional preferences changed accordingly, showing that the antenna-based clock helps calibrate their sun compass.

The sun compass is probably not the only tool they use. Evidence suggests that monarchs can sense the Earth’s magnetic field, which may serve as a backup or complementary navigation system, particularly under cloudy conditions when the sun is obscured. Experiments in controlled magnetic fields have indicated that monarch butterflies alter their directional behavior when the magnetic field is manipulated. The exact sensory structures involved are still being investigated, but light-dependent magnetoreception (using specialized molecules that respond to both light and magnetism) is one proposed mechanism.

In addition to the sun and magnetic cues, butterflies likely use a variety of local landmarks and environmental gradients. They may respond to large-scale visual patterns such as coastlines, mountain ranges, and river valleys. They may also detect gradients in temperature, humidity, or odors carried on the wind, though these are probably more important at regional scales than at the continental scale. Many migrations also follow and are constrained by geography; for example, monarchs funnel through particular mountain passes and valleys on their way to the overwintering forests.

Weather and seasonal cues play a major role in triggering migration in the first place. Day length (photoperiod) is one of the most important signals. As days grow shorter in late summer and early autumn, the combination of decreasing day length and changing temperature can cause developing monarch larvae and pupae to become the “migratory generation.” Hormonal changes associated with this developmental path lead to the long-lived, non-reproductive adults that are primed for migration rather than immediate breeding. In many species, a similar interaction between photoperiod and temperature triggers migratory behavior.

Wind patterns are another big factor. Butterflies are not strong enough to power through unfavorable winds over long distances, so selection has favored behavior that takes advantage of tailwinds and avoids strong headwinds. On days with favorable winds, large numbers of butterflies may take off together, resulting in impressive mass movements that observers can see even on weather radar. When winds are unfavorable, butterflies often rest, feed, and wait. This interplay between behavior and weather means that migration timing can vary from year to year.

Another aspect worth noting is that butterfly migration is not always a neatly organized, single-wave movement. In many species, it’s more like a broad, population-level tendency. Some individuals may travel farther than others, some may deviate from the main route, and there is a lot of variation. Nonetheless, when you look at the overall pattern, a clear directional movement emerges over space and time.

Human technology has greatly improved our understanding of these migrations over the last few decades. Tagging programs with tiny adhesive labels on monarch wings, for instance, have allowed researchers and citizen scientists to track where individual butterflies go. When tagged butterflies are recaptured or found hundreds or thousands of kilometers away, these data help map routes and estimate speeds. In some larger butterfly species, tiny radio transmitters or harmonic radar tags have been used to study short-term flight paths and behavior in more detail. Genetic studies also contribute, by revealing how populations remain connected over large geographical distances and how migratory and non-migratory populations differ.

The challenges butterflies face during migration are significant. They must find enough nectar along the route, avoid predators and bad weather, and reach their destination before conditions become too harsh. Human actions can make this harder. Habitat loss and fragmentation, herbicide use that kills host plants like milkweed, deforestation in overwintering sites, urbanization, and climate change all influence migratory butterflies. For monarchs in North America, the loss of overwintering forest in Mexico and the decline of milkweed in agricultural landscapes have been major conservation concerns. Climate change can alter the timing of migration, the distribution of suitable habitat, and the alignment between butterflies and the plants they need at each stage of their life cycle.

Despite these challenges, many migratory butterfly populations continue to persist, though some are under serious pressure. Conservation efforts include protecting overwintering sites, restoring native plants (especially host plants for caterpillars and nectar plants for adults) along migration routes, and reducing pesticide use. Because many migratory butterflies cross national borders, international cooperation is important for conserving them. Programs that involve the public—such as planting pollinator gardens, tagging butterflies, and reporting sightings—also contribute valuable data and build awareness.

From an evolutionary perspective, migration in butterflies demonstrates how even small, short-lived organisms can solve the problem of surviving in highly seasonal or variable environments. Instead of evolving to endure freezing winters or severe drought where they are, they have evolved to move, sometimes over immense distances, and to coordinate these movements across generations with precise timing. It involves physiological adaptations (like energy storage and diapause), behavioral adaptations (such as flight timing and route choices), and complex sensory capabilities (sun compass, circadian clock, possibly magnetoreception).

To summarize, butterflies migrate long distances by combining multiple strategies: using stored fat and constant refueling on nectar to sustain flight; timing their movements to favorable seasons and winds; relying on a sun compass and internal clock, and possibly the Earth’s magnetic field, to maintain direction; and structuring their life cycle so that different generations perform different parts of the journey. These mechanisms allow delicate-looking insects to perform journeys on a scale that, relative to their size, rivals some of the most spectacular migrations in the animal kingdom.
