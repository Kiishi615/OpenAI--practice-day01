Some stars end their lives in supernova explosions because their internal engines can no longer support their own gravity. When the balance between outward pressure (from nuclear fusion or other processes) and inward pull (gravity) collapses, the result can be a violent, catastrophic explosion. Which stars explode, and how, depends mainly on their mass and on whether they are single or in binary systems.

You can think of this topic in terms of two main families of supernovae:

    Corecollapse supernovae (massive stars blowing up)
    Thermonuclear supernovae (white dwarfs blowing up)

Ill walk through both, plus why not all stars explode.

    The basic tugofwar inside a star

A stars life is basically a balance:

    Gravity pulls everything inward.
    Outward pressure from hot gas and radiation (ultimately powered by nuclear fusion in the core) pushes outward.

As long as fusion in the core produces enough energy, the star is stable. Problems start when:

    The fuel in the core runs out, or
    The pressure source changes in a way that cant resist gravity anymore.

When the support fails suddenly, the core collapses. Under the right conditions, that collapse triggers a supernova.

    Massive stars: corecollapse supernovae

These are stars that start life with at least ~810 times the mass of the Sun. They burn through their fuel much faster than smaller stars, going through stages:

    Hydrogen  helium (like the Sun)
    Helium  carbon and oxygen
    Then progressively heavier elements: neon, magnesium, silicon...
    Eventually  an iron core

Why iron is a dead end
Fusion up to iron releases energy and helps support the star. But fusing iron into heavier elements does not release energy; it consumes energy. So once the core becomes mostly iron:

    Fusion cannot provide outward pressure.
    Gravity has nothing left to balance it.

What happens next depends on core mass and conditions, but a typical scenario:

Step 1: Core becomes unstable

    The iron core grows as fusion shells around it add more ash.
    When the core exceeds a critical mass (around the Chandrasekhar limit, ~1.4 times the mass of the Sun), it cannot support itself with electron degeneracy pressure (a quantum mechanical pressure from tightly packed electrons).

Step 2: Core collapse

    Electrons and protons are squeezed together, forming neutrons and neutrinos (electron capture).
    This causes a sudden loss of electron pressure; the core collapses at a significant fraction of the speed of light.
    The density rises to that of atomic nuclei; at that point, nuclear forces halt the collapse and the core rebounds slightly.

Step 3: The shock wave and explosion

    The collapsing outer layers slam into the now nearly solid neutron core and bounce, generating a shock wave moving outward.
    Initially, the shock stalls, but a huge burst of neutrinos from the core deposits energy into the surrounding matter.
    That extra energy revives the shock, which tears through the stars outer layers and blasts them into space: a corecollapse supernova.

The leftover core may become:

    A neutron star, if the mass isnt too high, or
    A black hole, if the core is massive enough that even neutron degeneracy pressure cannot support it.

Why these stars explode
In short:

    They become too heavy and dense at the core.
    Fusion turns from an energy source into a dead end (iron).
    Gravity wins, the core collapses, and the rebound + neutrino energy blow off the stars outer layers.

This type of supernova includes:

    Type II (hydrogen still visible in the spectrum)
    Some Type Ib and Ic (massive stars that lost their outer layers of hydrogen, and sometimes helium, before exploding)

    White dwarfs in binaries: thermonuclear supernovae

A different route to a supernova involves stars that are not massive enough to collapse as above. Stars like the Sun end their lives as white dwarfs: Earthsized, dense, mostly made of carbon and oxygen, supported by electron degeneracy pressure (no fusion in the core).

On their own, white dwarfs just cool over time. But in a binary system, a white dwarf can accrete (steal) matter from a companion star.

Two main ways to trigger a thermonuclear supernova:

A) Accretion from a normal star

    The white dwarf pulls in gas from a nearby companion.
    As it gains mass, it creeps toward the Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 solar masses), the maximum mass a white dwarf can support with electron degeneracy pressure.
    Near this limit, temperature and density in the interior rise until carbon fusion ignites explosively, almost all at once.
    Because the star is supported by degeneracy pressure, heating doesnt make it expand and cool; it just makes fusion run away.

B) White dwarf merger

    Two white dwarfs orbit each other and gradually spiral together due to gravitational wave emission.
    When they merge, the combined mass can exceed the Chandrasekhar limit.
    The resulting object ignites thermonuclear fusion in a runaway process.

In both cases, what happens:

    A runaway thermonuclear reaction burns much of the white dwarf (carbon and oxygen) into heavier elements (especially nickel and iron) in a fraction of a second.
    The energy release is so huge that it completely unbinds the star. No core remnant is left.
    This is observed as a Type Ia supernova (no hydrogen lines, characteristic light curve).

Why these stars explode

    They are supported by quantum degeneracy, not normal gas pressure.
    Once mass and conditions cross a threshold, fusion goes into a runaway that blows the star apart.
    Gravity never gets the chance to make a neutron star; the star is vaporized.

    Why not every star explodes

Most stars, including the Sun, will not become supernovae.

Low and intermediatemass stars (roughly up to ~8 solar masses):

    Evolve into red giants, then shed their outer layers as a planetary nebula.
    The core becomes a white dwarf.
    They are never massive enough to ignite advanced burning stages like full silicon  iron burning in the core, so they dont undergo core collapse.
    If they are isolated white dwarfs, they never reach the mass limit and do not explode.

So you need special conditions to get a supernova:

    Either:
        Start very massive, so your core goes all the way to iron and collapses under its own weight, or
    Be in a close binary (or merger) scenario where a white dwarf can reach critical mass and trigger a thermonuclear runaway.

    The different fates, summarized

By initial mass / configuration:

    Low mass (like the Sun, up to ~8 solar masses)
        End as white dwarfs
        No supernova (unless in a close binary later)

    Intermediate / massive (~825 solar masses, roughly)
        Evolve to an iron core
        Core collapses  corecollapse supernova  neutron star remnant

    Very massive (>~2530 solar masses, depends on details)
        Core collapses; may form a black hole
        Explosion might be weak, strong, or largely fail (some may collapse directly to black holes with little visible supernova, though this is still actively studied)

    White dwarf in a close binary (carbonoxygen WD)
        Accretion or merger  mass near or above Chandrasekhar limit
        Runaway thermonuclear explosion  Type Ia supernova, no remnant

    Why supernovae matter

The reasons some stars explode are tied to basic physics (gravity, nuclear fusion, quantum degeneracy), but the consequences are cosmic:

    They create and spread heavy elements (like iron, nickel, many elements beyond iron) into space, which later form planets and life.
    They seed the interstellar medium with energy and shock waves, triggering new star formation.
    Neutron stars and black holes products of core collapse super novae are key laboratories for extreme physics.

So some stars explode as supernovae because:

    Their cores either reach a point where gravity overwhelms all possible support (core collapse), or
    Their degenerate matter makes nuclear burning unstable and explosive when a critical mass is reached (thermonuclear).

Whether a given star explodes or not is mainly written in its mass and environment at birth.
