The Story of the Universe A long time ago about 13.8 billion years there was nothing. No stars, no planets, not even space or time. Then, in one incredible moment, everything began. We call that moment the Big Bang. From a tiny point, the universe expanded faster than light. In the first seconds, it was filled with pure energy, then simple particles protons, neutrons, and electrons. As it cooled, these particles joined to form atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium. Millions of years later, gravity pulled those atoms together, forming the first stars. Inside those stars, nuclear reactions created heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, and iron the very stuff we are made of. When massive stars exploded as supernovae, they scattered those elements into space, giving birth to new stars and planets. Our solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago. Dust and gas around a young star our Sun clumped together, creating Earth and the other planets. On Earth, chemistry became biology. Tiny living things appeared, evolved, and eventually led to humans, who now look up and wonder where it all began. Today, the universe is still expanding. Galaxies rush away from one another. Between them lies vast darkness filled with mystery dark matter and dark energy, which make up most of everything, yet we barely understand them. The universe is huge beyond imagination billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars. Yet somehow, in all that space, a small blue planet became home to life that can ask, Why are we here? And so, the story continues still unfolding, still unknown.
