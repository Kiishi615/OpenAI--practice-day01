The Clockmaker's Apprentice

In a quiet town stood an old clock shop run by Mr. Halden, a man who could fix any timepiece except one: the grand clock in his workshop that had stopped ticking twenty years ago. People whispered that it held memories of his late wife, Elara.

One rainy afternoon, a curious boy named Milo wandered in, soaked and shivering. He asked for work, and Mr. Halden, seeing a spark in the boy's eyes, agreed to take him as an apprentice. Milo watched, learned, and eventually dared to ask about the silent grand clock.

Mr. Halden avoided the topic for weeks until, one evening, he found Milo gently cleaning the clock's gears. Instead of scolding him, the old man joined him. Together, they discovered a small locket stuck in the clock's mechanism-Elara's locket, lost the day she died.

Mr. Halden wound the clock once more, and to his surprise, it began to tick. He smiled through tears, whispering, "Time moves again."

The next morning, the whole town heard the grand chime of the clock tower for the first time in decades. And Milo, now more like a son, continued the craft, carrying the rhythm of time forward.
