- 13.8 billion years ago: there was nothing—no stars, planets, space, or time
- Then the Big Bang: the universe began and expanded rapidly
- Early moments: pure energy followed by protons, neutrons, and electrons
- As it cooled: atoms formed, mostly hydrogen and helium
- Gravity gathered these atoms to form the first stars
- Inside stars: nuclear reactions created heavier elements (carbon, oxygen, iron)
- Massive stars exploded as supernovae, scattering elements into space
- New generations of stars and planets formed from this enriched material
- Our solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago
- Dust and gas around the young Sun clumped to make Earth and other planets
- On Earth, chemistry led to biology; life appeared and evolved
- Humans emerged and wonder about where it all began
- Today the universe continues to expand; galaxies recede from each other
- Dark matter and dark energy dominate the cosmos and are not well understood
- The universe is vast—billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars
- A small blue planet, Earth, hosts life that can ask why we are here
- The story continues, still unfolding and unknown
