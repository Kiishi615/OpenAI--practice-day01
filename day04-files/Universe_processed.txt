- About 13.8 billion years ago there was nothing; then the Big Bang created the universe.
- The expansion happened from a tiny point, faster than light.
- In the first seconds, the universe contained pure energy and simple particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons.
- As it cooled, atoms formed, mostly hydrogen and helium.
- Gravity gathered these atoms into the first stars.
- Inside stars, nuclear fusion created heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, and iron.
- Massive stars exploded as supernovae, scattering elements into space and seeding new stars and planets.
- Our solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from dust and gas around the young Sun.
- Earth and other planets formed; chemistry on Earth led to biology, life appeared and evolved, culminating in humans.
- Humans look up and wonder where it all began.
- The universe is still expanding; galaxies move away from one another.
- The space between galaxies is filled with dark matter and dark energy, which make up most of everything and are not well understood.
- The universe is vast—billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars.
- A small blue planet, Earth, became home to life capable of asking why we are here.
- The story continues, still unfolding and unknown.
